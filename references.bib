abstract = {A budget model is developed to predict the long-term response of a lake to changes in its phosphorus loading. This model computes total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, taking sediment-water interactions into account. The lake is treated as two segments: the water and a surface sediment layer. A total phosphorus budget for the water accounts for inputs due to external loading and recycle from the sediments. It reflects losses due to flushing and settling. The sediment layer gains total phosphorus by settling and loses total phosphorus by recycle and burial. The recycle from the sediments to the water is dependent on the levels of sediment total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen. Hypolimnetic oxygen concentration is estimated with a semi-empirical model. The model is applied to Shagawa Lake. An analysis is performed to demonstrate how its predictions replicate in-lake changes not possible with simpler phosphorus budget models.}

    abstract = { Abstract Internal loading as phosphorus (P) released from anoxic sediment surfaces often represents the main summer P load to lakes and reservoirs and can have an immense effect on their water quality. Many difficulties in internal load assessment exist, however, including ignoring internal load altogether, ambiguity about the origin of sediment released P and inexact definitions. Most of these problems are due to the difficulty in distinguishing internal from external P sources, which is particularly challenging in polymictic lakes. To prevent misconceptions and facilitate its evaluation, internal load in stratified and polymictic lakes should be expressed in a similar way to external loads: as annual, gross and areal load of total phosphorus (TP). Possible approaches to internal load quantification are: in situ determination from hypolimnetic P increases, mass balance approaches, and estimates from anoxic active area and P release. Further suggestions to facilitate the study of internal loading include: (a) the differentiation between polymictic and stratified lakes, sections of lakes, and time periods when evaluating indicators and impact of internal load; (b) the separation of internal load (upward flux) from sedimentation (downward flux) of external and internal loads, and (c) the consideration of the downward flux of both external (Lext, mg/m2/yr) and internal (Lint, mg/m2/yr) loads by a retention model (Rsed) when predicting lake TP averages in a mass balance model of the form (qs = annual areal water load in m/yr): }

abstract = {Abstract The pioneer works of Einsele, Mortimer, and Ohle on the linking between phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) cycles seven decades ago created the theoretical basis for a long-standing paradigm among limnologists i.e., ‘oxygen controls the P release from sediments’. While many empirical studies as well as strong correlations between oxygen depletion and P release seem to support this paradigm, various field observations, laboratory experiments, and repeated failures of hypolimnetic oxygenation measures cast doubt on its universal validity. The temporal existence of a thin oxidized sediment surface-layer could affect only fluctuations of the temporary P pool at the sediment surface but not the long-term P retention. On longer time scales P release is the imbalance between P sedimentation and P binding capacity of anoxic sediment layers. The P retention of lake sediments strongly depends on sediment characteristics and land use of the catchment. The presence of redox-insensitive P-binding systems such as Al(OH)3 and unreducible Fe(III) minerals can enhance the P retention and completely prevent P release even in case of anoxic conditions. Alternative release mechanisms such as a dissolution of calcium-bound P and decomposition of organic P under both, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, are often more important than the redox driven Fe-coupled P cycle. Additionally, bacteria affect P cycling not only by altering the redox conditions but also by releasing P during mineralization of organic matter and by accumulation and release of bacterial P. Since microbial processes consume oxygen and liberate P it is difficult to distinguish whether oxygen depletion is the result or the cause of P release. Nowadays, the old paradigm is discarded and a paradigm shift takes place. Sedimentary P exchange ought to be considered as a complex process which is mainly determined by the amount and species of settled P as well as their subsequent diagenetic transformation in the sediment. The classical paradigm is only valid in special cases since reality is much more complex than suggested by that paradigm. Everything should be made simple as possible, but not simpler!

    abstract = { Abstract Models of nutrient dynamics in Lake Okeechobee have not adequately simulated the lake's reduced capacity, over time, to remove phosphorus. These models lack processes to either simulate phosphorus saturation in sediments or internal loading to the water column from the sediments. We developed a relatively simple mass balance model that incorporates nonlinear Langmuir sorption dynamics previously used by Pollman (1983) to describe the partitioning of inorganic phosphorus between sediment aqueous and solid phases. This partitioning resulted in progressive saturation of sediment phosphorus exchange sites. The resulting model represents an improvement over earlier efforts but still yielded only modest agreement between observed and predicted annual values (r2= 0.38). Model residuals were significantly correlated with lake–water column calcium concentrations; therefore, the model was refined to include a predictive submodel for calcium, based on ambient loadings and precipitation to, or dissolution from, the sediments. The latter process was modeled kinetically, based on the deviation of water column concentrations from a calibrated equilibrium value. The submodel assumed that as particulate calcium dissolves it releases attached soluble reactive phosphorus. Although this additional source of phosphorus (P) to the lake was small (∼11\% compared to external inputs), it was significant during years when appreciable calcium dissolution occurred. As a result, the revised model performance was improved (r2= 0.48). The model indicates that internal fluxes of P exceed external inputs on average by a factor of 2.6. This internal flux will compromise the efficacy of load reduction measures taken to improve the water quality of Lake Okeechobee. }

The fluxes of dissolved methane and ammonia from the sediment to the overlying water, as well as methane and nitrogen gas fluxes that escape as bubbles, are included in the model. The three model parameters-the dissolved methane mass transfer coefficient and the two oxidation rate parameters-are estimated from laboratory and field data sets. The effect of overlying water dissolved oxygen and temperature is examined. The importance of the gas fluxes and their quantitative relationship to SOD is established. Any field program that includes the measurement of SOD should also include the measurement of the nitrogen and methane fluxes as well. The model is limited to freshwater sediments since the oxidation of sulfides is not included. The contribution from the respiration of benthic macro fauna is also not incorporated.},

abstract = { Hypolimnetic aeration was used in conjunction with reductions in phosphorus (P) inputs in order to lower the P concentrations in two eutrophic lakes. Based on more than 10 years of experience with artificial mixing and hypolimnetic oxygenation we conclude that the lakes' internal P cycling was not affected by increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (D.O.) concentrations. We show that irrespective of oxic conditions in the hypolimnion the sediment/water interface remained anoxic due to unchanged high sedimentation rates of organic matter. This may explain why oxygenation did not increase the P retention capacity of the sediment. However, the presented information indicates that, contrary to general assumption, anoxic sediment surface and high P release rates from lake sediments may not be cause-effect related but simply two parallel symptoms of one common cause:  excessive organic matter and P sedimentation exhausting the stock of hypolimnetic D.O. and exceeding the P retention capacity of the sediment after diagenesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that fighting one symptom (an anoxic hypolimnion and sediment surface) does not solve the other one (a high P release rate). These findings and considerations based on more than 10 years of experimental experience warrant a reevaluation of the well accepted theoretical management strategy of limiting lake internal P cycling by maintaining an aerobic hypolimnion and sediment surface. }

In Lake Sempach (Switzerland), hypolimnetic oxygen concentration was increased by artificial aeration after two decades of nearly anoxic conditions. Using diagenetic reaction-transport modeling and sediment core analysis, we investigated the effects that this change, as well as variations in the organic carbon loadings, had on the long-term mobility of sediment P. During low-oxygen conditions, the reducible iron pool in the sediment was depleted, resulting in the release of previously accumulated P. The remobilization of iron-bound P affected phosphate effluxes from the sediment on the time scale of the sediment iron cycle (several years). On longer time scales, P effluxes followed the sedimentation fluxes of organic matter. Mass balance calculations indicate that, despite the dominance of internal P loading in Lake Sempach, over the long-term phosphorus content in the water column was controlled by the external P inputs. The results suggest that, whereas short-term decreases in sediment P releases may be achieved by preventing sediment anoxia, long-term solutions should involve reductions in the external P inputs.}

abstract = {Abstract The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

This study quantified sediment P flux in Lake Eucha, northeastern Oklahoma, USA, and evaluated the effectiveness of chemical treatment to reduce sediment P flux. Six intact sediment–water columns were collected from three sites in Lake Eucha near the reservoir channel at depths of 10 to 15 m. Three intact sediment and water columns from each site were incubated for 21 d at approximately 22°C under aerobic conditions, and three were incubated under anaerobic conditions (N2 with 300 ppm CO2); sediment P flux was estimated over the 21 d for each core. The overlying water in the cores was bubbled with air for approximately 1 wk and then treated with aluminum sulfate (alum). The cores were incubated at approximately 22°C for an additional 14 d under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and sediment P flux after alum treatment was estimated for each core. Sediment P flux was approximately four times greater under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions. Alum treatment of the intact sediment–water columns reduced (8×) sediment P flux under anaerobic conditions. Internal P flux (1.03 and 4.40 mg m−2 d−1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively) was greater than external P flux (0.13 mg m−2 d−1). The internal P load (12 Mg yr−1) from reservoir bottom sediments was almost 25\% of the external P load (approximately 48 Mg yr−1) estimated using a calibrated watershed model.},

The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the P flux from various sediment types within the lake, (ii) the factors that control direction and magnitude of P flux, and (iii) the amount of P associated with various inorganic P phases within the sediment. Phosphorus flux was measured from intact sediment cores taken from eight sites that represent major sediment types and major inflows of Lake Okeechobee at four time periods in 1989–1990. At the same location-times, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in porewater was determined using porewater equilibrators and/or sediment cores. Results indicate that P flux from sediments is very sensitive to changes in O2 status of the overlying water, with anaerobic conditions promoting large P fluxes. Despite steep porewater DRP gradients in sediments (varying from 0.1 mg P L−1 at the sediment/water interface to more than 1 mg P L−1 at lower depths), P flux was not regulated by such gradients. Such lack of dependence of P flux on DRP gradients highlights the role redox reactions (involving Fe) can play in P chemistry in the top few centimeters of the sediment. Internal P loads (i.e., flux from bottom sediments) were found to be approximately equivalent to external P loads (≈1 mg P m−2 d−1).},

During the summer, Nakamun Lake was intermittently stratified and Halfmoon Lake was weakly, thermally stratified. During the stratified periods, water overlying the sediments was anoxic, TP levels increased in the deep water, and sediments were the main source of TP, contributing 1468 and 147 kg of TP to Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes, respectively. During these same periods, internal loading to Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes (12.7 and 15.6 mg∙m−2∙d−1, respectively) were slightly higher than the rates predicted from laboratory experiments on sediment cores (9.7 and 7.2 mg∙m−2∙d−1, respectively). Quantitative estimates of vertical water exchange in Nakamun Lake and in-lake TP budgets for both lakes indicated that phosphorus released from the sediments was transported to the surface water during mixing. After eight of the nine mixing events that immediatley followed stratified periods, [TP] increased 3–43\% and 31–52\% in the surf ace water of Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes, respectively. }

Mean concentrations of porewater P, loosely-bound P, iron- and aluminum-bound P, and mean rates of P release from sediments under anoxic conditions were high in the accumulation zone compared to sediment P characteristics in the erosional zone, indicating focusing of readily mobilized sediment P pools from shallow regions and accumulation to deep regions. We determined that a future alum treatment for control of internal P loading would be most effective at depths > 2.6 in the accumulation zone. The mean rate of anoxic P release from sediments encountered in the accumulation zone (8.3 mg m-2 d-1) was used in conjunction with a summer anoxic period of 122 d, and a treatment area of 1.6 km2 to estimate an internal P load of 1,600 kg to be controlled.

abstract = {Abstract The role of sediment biogeochemistry on diffusive flux of inorganic P was examined under laboratory conditions using intact sediment cores obtained from a subtropical hypereutrophic lake. The effect of light and dark conditions in the water column on soluble P flux from sediments was measured over a period of 1 yr. Soluble reactive P (SRP) level in the overlying water column was low (<0.01 mg P L–1) under light conditions, while values under dark conditions steadily increased. This suggests algal uptake under light conditions. Diffusive flux of soluble P from sediments as calculated by measuring the increase in concentration of the overlying water in the dark was 2.71 mg P m–2 d–1. Flux of this magnitude could increase lake water SRP levels by approximately 0.5 mg P L–1 yr–1. Soluble reactive P concentrations were roughly equivalent to dissolved P concentrations, both for the water column and for the sediment porewater. Porewater SRP increased with depth to a maximum of 6.0 mg P L–1 at 40 cm. Phosphorus flux as calculated from prewater SRP gradients averaged 1.69 mg P m–2 d–1. Sediment P fractionation indicated that water soluble P, KCl extractable P, and Fe and Al-bound P decreased with depth, whereas the amount of Ca-bound P increased. Calcium-bound P was the dominant fraction, comprising over 50\% of the total P content. Ion activity products (IAP) calculated using GEOCHEM indicated that the sediments were supersaturated with respect to apatite, beta tricalcium phosphate and whitlockite, with the latter expected to be the phase controlling PO–34 activities.},

abstract = {Lake eutrophication is associated with excessive anthropogenic nutrients (mainly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and unobserved internal nutrient cycling. Despite the advances in understanding the role of external loadings, the contribution of internal nutrient cycling is still an open question. A dynamic mass-balance model was developed to simulate and measure the contributions of internal cycling and external loading. It was based on the temporal Bayesian Hierarchical Framework (BHM), where we explored the seasonal patterns in the dynamics of nutrient cycling processes and the limitation of N and P on phytoplankton growth in hyper-eutrophic Lake Dianchi, China. The dynamic patterns of the five state variables (Chla, TP, ammonia, nitrate and organic N) were simulated based on the model. Five parameters (algae growth rate, sediment exchange rate of N and P, nitrification rate and denitrification rate) were estimated based on BHM. The model provided a good fit to observations. Our model results highlighted the role of internal cycling of N and P in Lake Dianchi. The internal cycling processes contributed more than external loading to the N and P changes in the water column. Further insights into the nutrient limitation analysis indicated that the sediment exchange of P determined the P limitation. Allowing for the contribution of denitrification to N removal, N was the more limiting nutrient in most of the time, however, P was the more important nutrient for eutrophication management. For Lake Dianchi, it would not be possible to recover solely by reducing the external watershed nutrient load; the mechanisms of internal cycling should also be considered as an approach to inhibit the release of sediments and to enhance denitrification.}

    abstract = { Many physical, chemical, and biological processes in freshwater ecosystems mobilize the nutrient phosphorus (P) from sediments, which in turn may contribute to the formation of harmful algal blooms. Here, we critically reviewed internal P loading in Canadian fresh waters to understand the geographic patterns and environmental drivers of this important process. From 43 publications, we consolidated 618 estimates of internal P loading from Canadian freshwater ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal wetlands (n = 70). Expressed in terms of total P, short-term gross rates in sediment samples (Lgross) ranged from −27 to 54 mg·m−2·day−1 (n = 461), while long-term net rates in whole ecosystems (Lnet) ranged from −1694 to 10 640 mg·m−2·year−1 (n = 157). The main environmental drivers of this variation were oxygen, pH, geology, and trophic state. Internal P loading tended to be higher during the open-water season and most prominent in small prairie lakes. Priorities for future research on internal P loading should include resolving methodological problems, assessing the relative importance of different mechanisms, examining the influence of anthropogenic activities, and quantifying rates in understudied ecosystems. }

abstract = {Increases in total P levels in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, have given rise to concern over eutrophication. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of redox potential and pH on the solubility of P in lake sediments. Bulk sediment samples were obtained from the mud zone of Lake Okeecbobee and were equilibrated under controlled conditions at fixed Eh and pH levels. The pH levels evaluated were 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5; the Eh levels studied were 500, 250, 0, and −250 mV. Redox reactions were very important in the regulation of P in Lake Okeechobee sediments. Under oxidized conditions, soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were low (≈ 0.1 mg P L−1), whereas under reducing conditions SRP increased to over 1 mg P L−1. Soluble reactive P was extremely high (18 mg P L−1) under acidic (pH 5.5), reducing (Eh < 0 mV) conditions. Water soluble Fe was highly correlated to water soluble P, implicating it as a possible agent governing P behavior. Sodium hydroxide-extractable P (Fe and Al bound) increased with increases in Eh, which indicated Fe phosphate precipitation or adsorption of P by Fe oxides or hydroxides. This was supported by mineral equilibria calculations, which showed porewaters were supersaturated with respect to strengite under oxidized conditions. Calcium-bound P was higher under reducing conditions. The results suggest that Fe phosphate precipitation controls the behavior of P in Lake Okeechobee sediments under oxidizing conditions, whereas Ca phosphate mineral precipitation governs P solubility under reducing conditions. These results also suggest that large fluxes of P from the sediment could occur if the lake water column were to experience low dissolved O2 levels, due to the reduction and subsequent solubilization of ferric phosphate minerals in surficial sediments. Measurements of P fluxes from intact sediment cores and porewater SRP profiles taken in situ supported this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Abstract Bottom sediments in shallow lakes can play a major role in releasing nutrients to the overlying water column during wind induced sediment resuspension or by constant flux due to diffusion. Internal nutrient loads due to these processes may be equal to or higher than external loads. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted on Lake Apopka, a shallow, hypereutrophic subtropical lake located in central Florida. Ammonium (NH+4) and soluble reactive P (SRP) flux during sediment resuspension were measured under laboratory conditions using intact sediment cores. Ammonium N and SRP flux due soley to diffusion were assessed using in situ porewater concentrations. Average diffusive flux from sediment to the overlying water was estimated to be 25 mg NH4-N m−2 d−1 and 1 mg P m−1 d−2. Resuspension fluxes of NH+4 and SRP were higher than diffusive flux. Soluble reactive P profiles of porewater showed distinct profile differentiation, with the surface 0 to 8 cm sediment depth acting as a P-depletion zone, and the underlying sediment displaying steep gradients in porewater SRP. These results suggest that dissolved NH+4 and SRP transport from the surface 8 cm of sediment was due to sediment resuspension, while below this depth, upward mobility of NH+4 and SRP was regulated by diffusion. Although dissolved N and P flux is upwards (from sediment to water column), during extended periods (annual cycle) the lake is functioning as a net sink for N and P by transforming inorganic pools of nutrients into organic forms and depositing them on the sediment surface.},

abstract={The sediment plays an important role in the overall nutrient dynamics of shallow lakes. In lakes where the external loading has been reduced, internal phosphorus loading may prevent improvements in lake water quality. At high internal loading, particularly summer concentrations rise, and phosphorus retention can be negative during most of the summer. Internal P loading originates from a pool accumulated in the sediment at high external loading, and significant amounts of phosphorus in lake sediments may be bound to redox-sensitive iron compounds or fixed in more or less labile organic forms. These forms are potentially mobile and may eventually be released to the lake water. Many factors are involved in the release of phosphorus. Particularly the redox sensitive mobilization from the anoxic zone a few millimetres or centimetres below the sediment surface and microbial processes are considered important, but the phosphorus release mechanisms are to a certain extent lake specific. The importance of internal phosphorus loading is highly influenced by the biological structure in the pelagic, and lakes shifting from a turbid to a clearwater state as a result of, for example, biomanipulation may have improved retention considerably. However, internal loading may increase again if the turbid state returns. The recovery period following a phosphorus loading reduction depends on the loading history and the accumulation of phosphorus in the sediment, but in some lakes a negative phosphorus retention continues for decades. Phosphorus can be released from sediment depths as low as 20 cm. The internal loading can be reduced significantly by various restoration methods, such as removal of phosphorus-rich surface layers or by the addition of iron or alum to increase the sediment's sorption capacity.},

abstract = {The western basin of Lake Erie experiences annual Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), which degrade water quality, threaten drinking water supplies, and deter recreation. The size of HABs in Lake Erie is highly correlated with the external loading of phosphorus (P) from a major tributary, the Maumee River, during spring and summer months. Because HAB size is largely explained by external loading, the contribution of P from lake sediments (internal loading) is considered to be minimal. However, if lake sediments become warmer and more hypoxic or anoxic in response to climate change, the relative contribution of internal P loading from sediments may become greater. In this study, we examined the potential effect of elevated lake temperatures on internal loading of P under anoxic conditions. Sediment cores were collected during Summer 2014 from 4 locations in the western basin of Lake Erie ranging from highly productive areas near Maumee Bay to less productive offshore areas. Cores were incubated for 4 days under anoxic conditions under different temperatures (10 °C, 20 °C, and 30 °C). P flux varied greatly between temperature treatments and sites. Average P flux at 20 °C and 30 °C were 2 and 14 times higher respectively, than for cores incubated at 10 °C. The site closest to the mouth of the Maumee River had the highest P flux, 10 times higher than the furthest site, and highest total P concentration in the surface sediment, 2 times higher than the furthest site, suggesting a gradient of sediment P characteristics associated with the Maumee River plume. Extrapolating these fluxes across the western basin suggests that with four days of anoxia at 30 °C, lake sediments could contribute ∼415 metric tons of dissolved P, which is equivalent to the springtime dissolved P loading from the Maumee River for 2011, the second-largest HAB on record.}

The aim was to describe the early recovery phase following an external loading reduction, i.e., when internal phosphorus loading is high, and to include seasonal dynamics. We calibrated a common set of model parameters for all 16 lakes and lake-specific estimates of the exchangeable phosphorus pool in the sediment (Ps). Estimated annual mean TP deviated on average 12\% from observed values in the 16 lakes. Moreover, the estimated seasonal dynamics and trend following the external loading reduction closely mimicked the observed pattern. The model was successfully tested on nine of the lakes for which data were available for an additional 7-yr period. The results suggest that TP in the sediment does not provide an adequate description of the exchangeable P pool. In Lake Arreskov, which has shifted from a turbid to a clear-water state following fish kill and biomanipulation, the model significantly overestimated TP, indicating that the model is inadequate for describing seasonal dynamics during the shift from a turbid to a clear-water state. Although simple, the empirical model predicts reasonably well the seasonal dynamics of TP following a P-loading reduction in a variety of shallow turbid lakes.},

After anaerobic conditions developed in late June, release from the profundal zone sediments contributed significant amounts of P to lake water. Sediment chemical properties were determined to estimate the size of the P reservoir in the profundal zone $(a water depths > 6.5 m)$. The P content of the surficial profundal zone sediments was 0.2-0.5\% (dry wt) and a significant fraction was potentially mobile (NaOH extractable). We calculate that the upper 10 cm of these sediments contain 50,000 kg of potentially mobile P, of which a small fraction is released each summer. Although external sources of phosphorus have been reduced by about 80\%, the feedback of P from the sediments is supporting the productivity of Shagawa Lake and may continue to do so for may years.},

abstract = {Abstract A warming climate is expected to lead to stronger thermal stratification, less frequent deep mixing, and greater potential for bottom water anoxia in deep, temperate oligotrophic lakes. As a result, there is growing interest in understanding nutrient cycling at the profundal sediment-water interface of these rare ecosystems. This paper assessed nutrient content and nutrient flux rates from profundal sediment at Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada, USA. Sediment is a large reservoir of nutrients, with the upper 5 cm containing reduced nitrogen (∼6,300 metric tons) and redox-sensitive phosphorus (∼710 metric tons) equivalent to ∼15 times the annual external load. Experimental results indicate that if deep water in Lake Tahoe goes anoxic, profundal sediment will release appreciable amounts of phosphate (0.13–0.29 mg P/m2·d), ammonia (0.49 mg N/m2·d), and iron to overlaying water. Assuming a 10 year duration of bottom water anoxia followed by a deep-water mixing event, water column phosphate, and ammonia concentrations would increase by an estimated 1.6 µg P/L and 2.9 µg N/L, nearly doubling ambient concentrations. Based on historic nutrient enrichment assays this could lead to a ∼40\% increase in algal growth. Iron release could have the dual effect of alleviating nitrate limitation on algal growth while promoting the formation of fine iron oxyhydroxide particles that degrade water clarity. If the depth and frequency of lake mixing decrease in the future as hydrodynamic models suggest, large-scale in-lake management strategies that impede internal nutrient loading in Lake Tahoe, such as bottom water oxygen addition or aluminum salt addition, may need to be considered.},

abstract = {Internal loading of phosphorus has been implicated as a major eutrophicating factor in Long Lake, Washington (Kitsap County). As a result of such loading, summer total phosphorus concentrations approach or exceed 100 μgP l−1. Most of the summer loading of phosphorus is thought to have been released directly from the rich, flocculent sediment in the mid and northern part of the lake as a result of high pH (up to 10) related to phytoplankton photosynthesis. The lake also supports a dense submersed macrophyte crop (areal weighted mean dry weight of about 220 g m−2) composed primarily of Elodea densa. Although excretion of phosphorus from healthy E. densa was found to be minimal, the potential contribution of P indirectly from sediment via macrophyte uptake and subsequent decomposition in the winter was on the order of 200–400 kg yr−1 or about 25–50\% of the external loading. Nevertheless, loading of phosphorus during predrawdown summers is thought to have originated largely as a direct release from sediment due to high pH. Estimates of sediment phosphorus release determined from laboratory experiments, mass balance and core analyses ranged from 2.2 to 5.6 mg m−2 day−1. As a component of the restoration program, the lake (mean depth of 2 m) was drawn down nearly 2 m for 4 months during the summer and fall of 1979. The lake's trophic status was expected to improve due to sediment consolidation and/or macrophyte reduction. The drawdown resulted in an 84\% reduction in macrophyte biomass in 1980 but minimal sediment consolidation (0.1 m). Winter decomposition of the much smaller macrophyte crop, apparently provided insufficient phosphorus in the spring to stimulate phytoplankton and to enrich midlake sediments, which has probably occurred in previous years. Low water column pH during the postdrawndown summer of 1980 resulted from relatively low rates of plankton photosynthesis. During the summer of 1980 internal loading of phosphorus was reduced and total phosphorus remained below 50 μg l−1.}

Because of the importance of internal phosphorus loading in the phosphorus budget of many eutrophic lakes, the chemical similarities between phosphate and arsenate, and the need to account for internal phosphorus loading as part of many lake restoration strategies, we carried out measurements to determine if the presence of nitrate also suppressed the release of phosphorus from the sediments of this lake during anoxia. Observations showed that this was the case. Arsenic, phosphorus, and iron (II) concentrations were strongly correlated in the water column, as expected, and the depths below which phosphorus and iron concentrations increased relative to epilimnetic values was predicted by the depth at which nitrate concentration approached zero. The results suggest that knowledge of a lake’s nitrogen budget may be a useful tool in the design of lake remediation efforts, even though phosphorus is typically the limiting nutrient.}

The flux was quantified from both aerobic and anaerobic incubations of whole cores; by monitoring the water encapsulated in bottom chambers; from pore water concentration profiles measured with a phosphate microelectrode, a diffusive equilibrium in thin films (DET) hydrogel, and expressed pore waters; and from mass balance and biogeochemical diagenetic models. Fluxes under aerobic conditions at summertime temperatures averaged 1.35mg P/m2/day and displayed spatial variability on scales as small as a centimeter. Using two different temperature correction factors, the flux was adjusted to mean annual temperature yielding average annual fluxes of 0.43–0.91mg P/m2/day and a western basin-wide total of 378–808Mg P/year as the diffusive flux from sediments. This is 3–7\% of the 11,000Mg P/year International Joint Commission (IJC) target load for phosphorus delivery to Lake Erie from external sources. Using these average aerobic fluxes, the sediment contributes 3.0–6.3μg P/L as a background internal contribution that represents 20–42\% of the IJC Target Concentration of 15μg P/L for the western basin. The implication is that this internal diffusive recycling of P is unlikely to trigger cyanobacterial blooms by itself but is sufficiently large to cause blooms when combined with external loads. This background flux may be also responsible for delayed response of the lake to any decrease in the external loading.}

    abstract = { AbstractWe developed a series of models using landuse and water-quality variables to predict sediment P release rates under anoxic conditions in reservoirs. We collected sediment cores from 17 reservoirs in the Central Plains region of the USA, and we measured nutrient release rates under anoxic conditions in laboratory incubation studies. We used corresponding landuse and water-quality data from the reservoirs to develop regression models for predicting P release rates. We used variables that relate directly to trophic state, including \% cropland in the watershed, which explained the greatest amount of variation in release rates. P release rates tended to be higher in reservoirs that had greater \% cropland in the watersheds. We developed additional predictive models using surface total P concentrations and Secchi disk depths. Trophic state was also a good predictor of release rates because more P was released from hypereutrophic reservoirs than from mesotrophic or eutrophic reservoirs. The median release rates for reservoirs representing different trophic state classes (e.g., mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic) were very similar to those previously reported for natural lakes. Our models can be used to predict sediment release rates in individual reservoirs of concern or to screen a large number of reservoirs to help direct resources to those systems that are most vulnerable to internal loading. Models based on landuse characteristics are particularly valuable because these data can be obtained from computer-based assessments and do not require labor-intensive field sampling. }

abstract = {Total P is increasing over time in the waters of Lake Okeechobee, Florida, but the concentrations do not correlate with external loads. The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the P flux from various sediment types within the lake, (ii) the factors that control direction and magnitude of P flux, and (iii) the amount of P associated with various inorganic P phases within the sediment. Phosphorus flux was measured from intact sediment cores taken from eight sites that represent major sediment types and major inflows of Lake Okeechobee at four time periods in 1989-1990. At the same location-times, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in porewater was determined using porewater equilibrators and/or sediment cores. Results indicate that P flux from sediments is very sensitive to changes in O2 status of the overlying water, with anaerobic conditions promoting large P fluxes. Despite steep porewater gradients DRP in sediments (varying from 0.1 mg P L-1 at the sediment/water interface to more than I mg P L-1 at lower depths), P flux was not regulated by such gradients. Such lack of dependence of P flux on DRP gradients highlights the role redox reactions (involving Fe) can play in P chemistry in the top few centimeters of the sediment. Internal P loads (i.e., flux from bottom sediments) were found to be approximately equivalent to external P loads ($\sim$1 mg P -2 d-l).},

abstract = {Eutrophication is one of the most common causes of water quality impairment of inland and marine waters. Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.},

abstract = {Abstract Diel pH changes in lake waters resulting from high photosynthetic activity may regulate water-soluble P concentration (WSP) and P sorption by suspended sediments in shallow eutrophic lakes. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the pH effect on P fractions and P sorption kinetics in oxidized sediment suspensions from two subtropical lakes (Lake Apopka and Lake Okeechobee, Florida). The P sorption rate was calculated for sediment suspensions adjusted to various pH levels: 6.5, 7.0, 8.5, 9.5, and 10.5 for Lake Apopka and 6.5, 7.0, 8.5, 9.5, and 10.5 for Lake Okeechobee. A decrease in pH increased the WSP concentrations in Lake Apopka sediment suspensions but had no effect on WSP concentrations in Lake Okeechobee sediment suspensions. Lake Apopka sediment suspensions at pH 7.0 (ambient) and below did not show net P uptake. Phosphorus uptake for Lake Apopka occurred only when pH was increased to ≥8.5 and when P treatments were increased to ≥27 mmol P kg−1, which resulted in supersaturation with respect to octacalcium phosphate. Phosphate solubility diagrams and mineral equilibria calculations suggest that P uptake by Lake Apopka sediment suspensions at pH ≥8.5 was due to P coprecipitation with CaCO3 and probable formation of nonapatitic Ca-P compounds. Phosphorus sorption on Lake Okeechobee sediment suspensions followed first-order kinetics for all pH levels studied, with rate constants (k) ranging from 0.003 to 0.75 h−1. High P uptake by Lake Okeechobee sediment suspensions could be attributed to two reactive components: (i) amorphous or poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxyhydroxides at pH <7.5, and (ii) Ca/Mg carbonates and other minerals at pH ≥7.5.},

abstract = {Eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs has prompted interest in using sediment capping technology to reduce the sediment contribution to internal nutrient loading. One such sediment capping technology is Phoslock®, a lanthanum-embedded clay, which can bind phosphate at the sediment surface and limit its diffusion into the water column. However, in well-oxygenated lakes, naturally occurring iron can bind phosphate by a similar mechanism. We sought to test the efficacy of Phoslock® in limiting phosphate (PO43−) fluxes relative to untreated iron-rich lake sediment under conditions of bottom-water oxia and anoxia through laboratory batch core incubations of intact sediment cores from Jordan Lake, a reservoir in central North Carolina. We found that Phoslock® decreased phosphate fluxes relative to the control under anoxic conditions (7.5 ± 9.5 vs. 236 ± 74 µmol PO43−•m−2•d−1), but provided no benefit relative to the control when the water column was oxygenated (4.5 ± 4.3 vs. 7.0 ± 11.4 µmol PO43−•m−2•d−1). We also found that Phoslock® itself can act as a source of NH4+ to Jordan Lake waters. Applied at recommended levels to the whole lake, Phoslock® addition would result in a pulse increase in water column NH4+ concentrations of approximately 2.6 ± 0.8 μM (an increase of 10 to 275\% compared to ambient).}

    abstract = { Release rates of phosphorus from anoxic sediment surfaces in seven North American lakes were determined from core tube incubations. These rates were compared with several P fractions within the 0–5 and 5–10 cm layers of the corresponding sediment. Regressions of release rates both on total sediment P and on reductant-soluble P were highly significant. Analysis of literature data from lakes worldwide also showed significant relationships between the release rates and total sediment P and citrate dithionite bicarbonate extractable P. Mass balance calculations for individual cores indicated that reductant-soluble P decreases in wet surficial sediments, while total P in the overlying water increases. The release rates of different P fractions in the water — total, soluble reactive, and total reactive P — were very similar, indicating the high biological availability of the released P. }
